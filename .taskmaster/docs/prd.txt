# RottenTomatoesReelScore – Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
RottenTomatoesReelScore is a Chrome Extension that augments movie and TV show pages on RottenTomatoes.com by displaying an additional rating called the **"Reel Score."** The Reel Score visualizes the difference between the Tomatometer (critics' score) and Popcorn Meter (audience score) to highlight potential disconnects between critics and audiences.

## 2. Problem Statement
Rotten Tomatoes shows two separate scores (Tomatometer & Popcorn Meter) but provides no quick metric summarizing how much critics and audiences disagree. Users who care about this disparity must mentally calculate the difference. A simple, attention-grabbing indicator will improve decision-making for moviegoers who weigh audience opinion over critics (or vice versa).

## 3. Goals & Objectives
- Enable users to instantly see the magnitude and direction of critic-audience disagreement.
- Provide an intuitive visual cue (color-coded circle + thumb icon) without cluttering the UI.
- Maintain performance; the extension should not noticeably slow page loads.
- Adhere to Chrome Web Store policies and RottenTomatoes' terms of service.

## 4. Success Metrics
| Metric | Target |
| ------ | ------ |
| Reel Score renders within | 200 ms of scores being visible |
| Bundle size | ≤ 150 KB (minified & gzipped) |
| Active users (Month 3) | 1,000 installs |
| Crashes / JS errors | < 1 % of page loads |

## 5. User Stories
1. **As a moviegoer**, I want to quickly understand if critics & audiences disagree so I can pick movies matching my taste.
2. **As a casual browser**, I want a simple visual that doesn't overwhelm the existing page design.
3. **As a power user**, I want an option to disable the Reel Score on demand.

## 6. Core Features
| # | Feature | Description | Priority |
| - | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| F1 | Score Extraction | Read Tomatometer & Popcorn Meter percentages from the DOM. | P0 |
| F2 | Reel Score Calculation | Compute difference: `Popcorn Meter – Tomatometer`. | P0 |
| F3 | UI Badge Injection | Inject a circular badge next to each existing score area. | P0 |
| F4 | Color / Icon Logic | Positive difference → green badge with 👍; negative → red badge with 👎; 0 → gray badge. | P0 |
| F5 | Tooltip | On hover, show "Audience score is X % higher/lower than critics." | P1 |
| F6 | Options Page | Simple toggle to enable/disable extension or badge opacity. | P2 |
| F7 | i18n | Support at least English; structure for future locales. | P3 |

## 7. Visual Design
- **Positive Reel Score**: Green (#2ecc71) circle, white text, thumbs-up icon.
- **Negative Reel Score**: Red (#e74c3c) circle, white text, thumbs-down icon.
- **Zero**: Gray (#95a5a6) circle, neutral hand icon.
- Badge placed flush right of the Tomatometer and Popcorn Meter labels (desktop & mobile breakpoints).
- Use font consistent with existing Rotten Tomatoes typography for number (e.g., ShockSans on site if available, else fallback).

## 8. Technical Requirements
1. **Stack**: Vanilla JS (ES6+), minimal dependencies. Use Chrome Manifest V3.
2. **DOM Integration**: Observe dynamic page navigation (Rotten Tomatoes is an SPA). Use MutationObserver.
3. **Performance**: Debounce DOM queries; avoid polling.
4. **Bundling**: Use Vite or ESBuild for small bundle.
5. **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier.
6. **Testing**: Jest + jsdom for logic; Playwright (optional) for E2E.
7. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions to lint, test, and package on tag release.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: No remote code injection. Follow CSP rules.
- **Privacy**: Extension only accesses RottenTomatoes.com pages; no personal data collected.
- **Accessibility**: Provide `aria-label` describing the Reel Score.

## 10. Out of Scope (v1)
- Firefox / Safari ports.
- Historical score charts.
- Notifications when scores change.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Rotten Tomatoes DOM changes break selectors | Medium | High | Use robust selectors; include automated tests; monitor errors. |
| Extension rejected by Chrome Store | Low | High | Follow policy guidelines; run extension-checker before submission. |
| Users misunderstand sign of score | Low | Medium | Include color & thumb icon plus tooltip text for clarity. |

## 12. Timeline (Tentative)
| Week | Milestone |
| ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Project setup, DOM exploration, score extraction prototype |
| 2 | Badge UI, color/icon logic, MVP ready |
| 3 | Options page, i18n scaffolding, lint/test setup |
| 4 | Polishing, performance tuning, publish to Chrome Web Store |

## 13. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- Extension installs and activates without errors.
- On any movie or show page, badge appears within 200 ms after both scores render.
- Color & icon reflect sign of difference; value is absolute magnitude.
- Tooltip text accurately explains the Reel Score difference.
- Disabling the extension via options immediately hides badges.
